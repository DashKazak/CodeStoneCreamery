Idea 1: US Bank mentioned digital transformation that involves bigger reliance on app - less phone calls and less brick and mortar branches. We though how the only time we actually call the bank is when we feel the need for immediate feedback: such as when we see a weird transaction on our app. To lessen the amount of stress and need for calling the bank, we want to give users the options to get immediate access to more information on the transaction.
